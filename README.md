# **Anomaly Detection – Smart Zone-Based Monitoring** 🚀  

## **Overview**  
This project is an **AI-powered smart zone monitoring system** designed for **security applications**. Instead of complex action recognition, it detects **unauthorized presence** in predefined restricted areas.  

### **Why This?**  
🔹 **Lighter & faster** than full action recognition.  
🔹 **Easier deployment** for real-world security setups.  
🔹 **Works with static surveillance cameras.**

## **Features** (Planned & Implemented ✅)  
✔️ **Intrusion detection** in marked zones.  
✔️ **Configurable detection areas** for different security setups.  
🔄 **(Planned)** Real-time alerts & notifications.  
🔄 **(Planned)** API for easy integration.  
🔄 **(Planned)** Edge device deployment for efficiency.

## **Setup & Installation**  
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fw7th/AnomalyDetection.git
   cd AnomalyDetection
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the detection module:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
_(Modify steps based on your actual implementation.)_

## **How It Works**  
1. **Define restricted zones** on a surveillance feed.  
2. **AI detects intrusions** in marked areas.  
3. **Alerts & logs unauthorized access** (coming soon).

## **Future Plans & Improvements**  
📌 **Optimize model for real-time detection.**  
📌 **Deploy as a cloud-based API.**  
📌 **Improve accuracy & reduce false positives.**
